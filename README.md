CartCrafters is a RESTFUL auction website, akin to auctioning websites like eBay. An account is required to access the service, and items can be put up for sale under a Foward or Dutch auction. Developed in Java, and built on Apache Tomcat. 

# Installation
1. Ensure you have Apache Tomcat version 10.1 installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t, you can get it from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi).
2. Download the project zip file, and extract it.
3. In your IDE, import an existing Maven project, and select the project.
4. Search through ***src*** folder, and find ***context.xml*** file within the **META-INF** folder.
5. Open the context.xml file with a text editor.
6. Change the ***url*** variables to match the path to the project. Ensure you use the following format:
```
jdbc:sqlite:<project-path>\CartCrafters\src\main\resources\<database-name>.db
```
7. Run the project.

Should you run into any issues, try these methods:
- Right click the main project folder in your IDE, click ***Maven***, and then ***Update Project***.
